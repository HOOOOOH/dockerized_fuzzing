This image also provides 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 tags.

## Guidance

Fuzzing MP3Gain 1.6.2 as an example.

### Step1: System configuration

Run these commands as root or sudoer, if you have not or rebooted:

```
echo "" | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first # tfuzz require this
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space # vuzzer require this
```

Error message like `No such file or directory` is fine, and you can just ignore it.

Note: 

Although not all configuration are required by this fuzzer, we provide these command in a uniform manner for consistency between different fuzzers. 

These commands may impair your system security (turning off ASLR), but not a big problem since fuzzing experiments are normally conducted in dedicated machines.

Instead of `echo core > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` given by many fuzzers which still generate a core dump file when crash happens, 
here we disable core dump file generation to reduce I/O pressure during fuzzing. [Ref](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html).

### Step2: Compile target programs

Download the source code, compile using `/honggfuzz/hfuzz_cc/hfuzz-clang`.

```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3gain/files/mp3gain/1.6.2/mp3gain-1_6_2-src.zip/download -O mp3gain-1_6_2-src.zip
mkdir -p mp3gain1.6.2 && cd mp3gain1.6.2
unzip ../mp3gain-1_6_2-src.zip

docker run --rm -w /work -it -v `pwd`:/work --privileged zjuchenyuan/honggfuzz sh -c "make clean; make"
```

### Step3: Preparing Seed Files

[UNIFUZZ](https://github.com/UNIFUZZ/seeds) provides seed files with various types. Here we provides 10 mp3 seed files, to be downloaded to `seed_mp3` folder.

```
# apt install -y subversion
svn export https://github.com/UNIFUZZ/dockerized_fuzzing_examples/trunk/seed/mp3 seed_mp3
```

### Step4: Fuzzing!

```
mkdir -p output/honggfuzz/queue
docker run --rm -w /work -it -v `pwd`:/work --privileged zjuchenyuan/honggfuzz \
    /honggfuzz/honggfuzz -f seed_mp3 -W output/honggfuzz/output \
        --covdir_all output/honggfuzz/queue --threads 1 -- \
        ./mp3gain ___FILE___
```

### Explanation

#### honggfuzz parameters

- `-f seed/mp3`: input seed folder
- `-W output/honggfuzz/output`: output folder, store crashes & runtime files
- `--covdir_all output/honggfuzz/queue`: queue folder, this is important if you don't want seed folder being tampered
- `--threads 1`: only run 1 instance, instead of number of CPUs/2
- `__FILE__`: equivalent to @@ in AFL command line
